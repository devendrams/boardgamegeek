This app searches the data from [BoardGameGeek.com](http://www.boardgamegeek.com).  It's not a game itself - it's a reference tool that provides information about board games.

See what's changed in the [Release Notes](https://code.google.com/p/boardgamegeek/wiki/ReleaseNotes).

See what we're planning for on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/pRZWIOOv/boardgamegeek-for-android).

The installer is available through the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boardgamegeek). If you want to get the APK without going through the Play store, you can find it shared on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1pW1xVqotJ9NFQ5aTNrYXpCWGM&usp=sharing).
